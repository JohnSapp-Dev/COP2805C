The files included in this repository represent the Homework assignments and the final project. The Homework assignments represent topics covered in class

### Project Description
___

- Homework 1 Commission Calculator
  > A simple program that calculates a commission rate based on sales made in a month.
- Homework 2 Collections Framework - sorter
  > A program that sorts a list of doubles.
- Homework 3 Generic Functions
  > Demostrats generic functions by passing arrays of different types and finding the minimum value. 
- Homework 4 File Management
  > This program reads in a file to an array, sorts the array, and writes the sorted array to a new file.
- Homework 5 Swing GUI
  > Creates a simple graphical user interface that allows the user to input a string and save that string in a list. The user can also remove an individual string or clear the entire array. 
- Homework 6 SQL with Java
  > A simple program that interacts with a local MySQL server to output the contents of a table
- Homework 7 Fibonacci calculator
  > This program creates two threads to race the time complexity of two methods of calculating the Fibonacci number at a given place. 
- Homework 8 Andriod App
  > Creates an Andriod application that converts currency from USD to one of three other currencies; CAD, YEN, and EUR. The conversation rates are hard coded.
- Final Project Server/client GUI
  > The final project establishes a local connection between a client and a server. The user interacts with the client via a GUI that sends a request to the server. This program calculates the Fibonacci number at a given place. The user inputs a number via the client GUI and the server responds with the Fibonacci number at the given place.
